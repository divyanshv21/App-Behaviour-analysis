#### Conclusion
With our model we get 
- Test Data Accuracy: 0.7680
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: 0.767 (Â± 0.009)


The efforts have yielded a robust model capable of accurately labeling new users as "highly likely" or "unlikely" to subscribe to our subscription products based on their app behavior. To validate our results, we propose running predictions on daily new installs and monitoring the consistency of our accuracy. By doing so, we can streamline our marketing efforts towards users deemed "unlikely" to subscribe, thus optimizing our subscription rate.

The increase in overall subscriptions serves as a tangible measure of the efficacy of this model for the company. It's important to note that users already inclined to subscribe will likely do so without extensive marketing efforts. However, for users at risk of leaving, strategic offers could incentivize them to become paid subscribers. For instance, offers such as "1 month free" or "50% off yearly subscriptions" can be compelling incentives. Importantly, structuring offers in a manner that encourages long-term commitment benefits the company, as it secures user loyalty over an extended period.
